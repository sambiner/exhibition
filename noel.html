		<h1>Yearbook and English 10 section</h1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><b>In Yearbook, we had to use photoshop and make a portrait about our interviewee in World History.  But it wasn't any ordinary portrait.  We had to gather together 25 different pictures that represented our interviewee, and then mix them together in photoshop, mess with the photo setting so that there was no hard edges, and the phiotos blended together so that you couldn't see where one picture started and where another began.</b></p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><b>In English 10, we did an essay based upon our interview.  We had to chose one topic from the interview that our interviewee said and then write a 2 page paper, MLA format, about that topic, and branching off a little to have more content.  I have a screenshot of it, and if you click the screenshot, it will take you to the actual document where you can read the entirety of it. </b></p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><b>The picture on the far left is the photoshop of my interviewee that I made after the interview.  The picture in the middle is the essay for English that I had to make based off of a topic ,my interviewee said in the interview, then I expanded off of that topic.  The picture on the far right is the reflection for my subject layered portrait. </b></p>

		<h1>Project 2: A Timely Solution</h1>
		<br>
		<p><b>In Noel's class, we had to choose a picture from the Industrial Revolution times, and analyze it.  After we analyzed it, then we had to make a flash draft of a poem.  If you turned the flash draft of the poem in on time, then she would look over the poem and give us feedback.  With the feedback, we needed to make a better, revised version of our flash draft.  Then, we needed to make a collage about the poem and picture, and, with the collage, we made an artist's statement.  I will show you the picture, the poem and the collage with the artist's statement.  </b></p>

		<p><b>Then, after the first poem, we needed to read two different articles about Social Media and another topic.  I chose Social Media and Mental Health.  I learned about how technology is "ruining" a generation, and I knew I could make a poem out of it.  Below is my poem, my mixed-media art, and my artist's statement.  </b></p>
